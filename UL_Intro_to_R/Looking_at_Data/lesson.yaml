  Version: 2.2.11

- Class: text
  Output: Whenever you're working with a new dataset, the first thing you should do is look at it! What is the format of the data? What are the dimensions? What are the variable names? How are the variables stored? Are there missing data? Are there any flaws in the data?

- Class: text
  Output: This lesson will teach you how to answer these questions and more using R's built-in functions. We'll be using a dataset of comic book super heroes.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: I've stored the data for you in a variable called heroes. Type ls() to list the variables in your workspace, among which should be heroes.
  CorrectAnswer: ls()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='ls()')
  Hint: Use ls() to list the variables in your workspace.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's begin by checking the class of the heroes variable with class(heroes). This will give us a clue as to the overall structure of the data.
  CorrectAnswer: class(heroes)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='class(heroes)')
  Hint: Use class(heroes) to check the class of the heroes variable.

- Class: text
  Output: It's very common for data to be stored in a data frame. It is the default class for data read into R using functions like read.csv() and read.table(), which you'll learn about in another lesson.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Since the dataset is stored in a data frame, we know it is rectangular. In other words, it has two dimensions (rows and columns) and fits neatly into a table or spreadsheet. Use dim(heroes) to see exactly how many rows and columns we're dealing with.
  CorrectAnswer: dim(heroes)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='dim(heroes)')
  Hint: Use dim(heroes) to see the exact dimensions of the heroes dataset.

- Class: text
  Output: The first number you see (734) is the number of rows (observations) and the second number (10) is the number of columns (variables). 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: You can also use nrow(heroes) to see only the number of rows. Try it out.
  CorrectAnswer: nrow(heroes)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='nrow(heroes)')
  Hint: Use nrow(heroes) to see only the number of rows.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: ... And ncol(heroes) to see only the number of columns.
  CorrectAnswer: ncol(heroes)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='ncol(heroes)')
  Hint: Use ncol(heroes) to see only the number of columns.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: If you are curious as to how much space the dataset is occupying in memory, you can use object.size(heroes).
  CorrectAnswer: object.size(heroes)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='object.size(heroes)')
  Hint: object.size(heroes) will tell you how much memory is occupyed by the heroes data frame.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now that we have a sense of the shape and size of the dataset, let's get a feel for what's inside. names(heroes) will return a character vector of column (i.e. variable) names. Give it a shot.
  CorrectAnswer: names(heroes)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='names(heroes)')
  Hint: names(heroes) will return a character vector of column (i.e. variable) names.

- Class: text
  Output: We've applied fairly descriptive variable names to this dataset, but that won't always be the case. A logical next step is to peek at the actual data. However, our dataset contains over 5000 observations (rows), so it's impractical to view the whole thing all at once.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The head() function allows you to preview the top of the dataset. Give it a try with only one argument.
  CorrectAnswer: head(heroes)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='head(heroes)')
  Hint: head(heroes) will show you the very top of the dataset.

- Class: text
  Output: Take a minute to look through and understand the the output above. Each row is labeled with the observation number and each column with the variable name. Your screen is probably not wide enough to view all 10 columns side-by-side, in which case R displays as many columns as it can on each line before continuing on the next.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: By default, head() shows you the first six rows of the data. You can alter this behavior by passing as a second argument the number of rows you'd like to view. Use head() to preview the first 10 rows of heroes.
  CorrectAnswer: head(heroes, 10)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='head(heroes, 10)')
  Hint: head(heroes, 10) will show you the first 10 rows of the dataset.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The same applies for using tail() to preview the end of the dataset. Use tail() to view the last 15 rows.
  CorrectAnswer: tail(heroes, 15)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='tail(heroes, 15)')
  Hint: tail(heroes, 15) will show you the last 15 rows of the dataset.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: After previewing the top and bottom of the data, you probably noticed lots of NAs, which are R's placeholders for missing values. Use summary(heroes) to get a better feel for how each variable is distributed and how much of the dataset is missing.
  CorrectAnswer: summary(heroes)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='summary(heroes)')
  Hint: Try summary(heroes) to look at how each variable is distributed and how many missing values we are dealing with.

- Class: text
  Output: summary() provides different output for each variable, depending on its class. For numeric data such as Weight, summary() displays the minimum, 1st quartile, median, mean, 3rd quartile, and maximum. These values help us understand how the data are distributed.

- Class: text
  Output: For categorical variables (called 'factor' variables in R), summary() displays the number of times each value (or 'level') occurs in the data. For example, 720 heroes have unique names. In contrast, the summary for Race (also a factor variable) tells us that our dataset contains 208 Human heroes, 63 Mutant heroes, etc.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: You can see that R truncated the summary for several factor varialbes by including a catch-all category called 'Other'. Since it is a categorical/factor variable, we can see how many times each value actually occurs in the data. Try table(heroes$Race).
  CorrectAnswer: table(heroes$Race)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='table(heroes$Race)')
  Hint: table(heroes$Race) will display counts for each level of the factor variable.

- Class: text
  Output: Each of the functions we've introduced so far has its place in helping you to better understand the structure of your data. However, we've left the best for last....

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Perhaps the most useful and concise function for understanding the *str*ucture of your data is str(). Give it a try now.
  CorrectAnswer: str(heroes)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='str(heroes)')
  Hint: Use str(heroes) to look at the structure of your data.

- Class: text
  Output: The beauty of str() is that it combines many of the features of the other functions you've already seen, all in a concise and readable format. At the very top, it tells us that the class of heroes is 'data.frame' and that it has 734 observations and 10 variables. It then gives us the name and class of each variable, as well as a preview of its contents.

- Class: text
  Output: str() is actually a very general function that you can use on most objects in R. Any time you want to understand the structure of something (a dataset, function, etc.), str() is a good place to start.

- Class: text
  Output: In this lesson, you learned how to get a feel for the structure and contents of a new dataset using a collection of simple and useful functions. Taking the time to do this upfront can save you time and frustration later on in your analysis.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Would you like to inform someone about your successful completion of this lesson?
  CorrectAnswer: NULL
  AnswerChoices: Yes; No
  AnswerTests: notify()
  Hint: NULL
